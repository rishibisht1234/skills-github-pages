# Hi, I’m Rishi 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I’m a **B.Tech CSE (AI & ML)** student who loves exploring how things work under the hood. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and turning ideas into reality. Currently, I’m sharpening my foundations with **CS50x 2026** while learning the ML side by side.

## What I’m Into

- 💻 Programming in C++ and Python  
- 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms  
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
- 🌐 Web Development (Flask, frontend basics)  
- 🏆 Competitive coding & challenges  

## What You’ll Find Here

This site is where I’ll share:

- My learning journey  
- Projects and experiments  
- Notes, ideas, and insights  
- Things I build while exploring tech  

I believe in learning deeply, staying curious, and improving a little every day.

Thanks for stopping by! ✨  
Feel free to explore and grow with me.
